# MachLearnMATLAB
----------
Implementation of a wide variety of Machine Learning algorithms and models in MATLAB.  

| # | Notebook | Description |
| --- |----------|-------------|
|1|LinearRegression| ...|
|2|LogisticRegression| First use of sigmoid |
|3|NeuralNetworks| Over the well known MNIST dataset |

All scripts follow a general structure:
1. Data import and descriptive analytics (often using the MNIST dataset)
2. Implementation of a somewhat simple model and initial testing
3. Implementation of the advanced model and exhaustive testing
4. Parameter tuning and further improvements

## Motivation
Resurging interest in machine learning is due to the same factors that have made data mining and data science more popular than ever. Huge volumes and varieties of available data, cheaper and more powerful computational processing, and affordable data storage have made it one of the hottest topics nowadays. Besides, MATLAB is the most important engineering tool there is. This repository combines them both

## Sources and acknowledgments
The initial assignments come from the course in [Machine Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/home/welcome) taught in Coursera by [Andrew NG](http://www.andrewng.org/)

The original notebooks come from such course. Nevertheless, major changes and refactoring have been performed by the author, covering more than 50% of the code.  

The notebooks are based on publicly available data.
